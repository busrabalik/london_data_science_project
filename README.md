# 🕵️‍♀️ London Crime Classification – Data Science Learning Project

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project is a personal study I started to learn and internalize fundamental concepts in the field of data science through hands-on application and structured documentation.

My goal is not just to build a working model, but to deeply understand and practice each of the following steps:

- Data preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Dimensionality reduction (PCA)  
- Model building and evaluation  
- Creating an iterative trial-and-error learning loop

Rather than following a passive course or watching tutorials, I prefer learning by doing — and this project reflects exactly that approach.

## 📂 Why This Dataset?

The dataset comes from the [“Data Science London + Scikit-learn”](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/data-science-london-scikit-learn) competition on Kaggle.

There are a few key reasons why I chose this specific dataset:

- It can be slightly challenging for beginners — there are no column names or detailed explanations.  
- But that’s exactly what makes it flexible and ideal for experimenting with models and feature engineering.  
- The format is clean and ready to use.  
- It simulates real-world uncertainty and missing context — a great opportunity to build from scratch.  
- So instead of being limited by rigid instructions, this dataset encourages creative problem solving.

This was a conscious choice to support my learning process.
